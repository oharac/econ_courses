Ted's 2006 paper, "Benefit-Cost in a Benevolent Society," begins with the dilemma he presented in class - Alice and Bob, wanting to rent an apartment, and each has some regard for the utility of the other - Alice wants Bob to have his den, while Bob wants Alice to have her study.  However, as presented in class (and counter to my intuition), when examining the costs and benefits associated with the renting of a bigger apartment, the analysis should include only the *private* benefits to both Bob and Anne.  The idea is that, if in calculating the total benefit and including each person's regard for the welfare of others, we would essentially be double counting (as noted in the North Carolina example).

In the paper (as in class) we considered a utility function for person $i$ that accounted for the utilities of all others:
$$U_i(x, y) = U_i(v_1(x_1, y), v_2(x_2, y), ..., v_n(x_n, y))$$
The terminology is fun: this kind of utility function is called "nonmalevolent" or "non-paternalistic."  If $U_i$ is constant for all $j \neq i$, then $i$ is selfish; if both nonmalevolent and not selfish, then $i$ is benevolent.  

Again as seen in class, Figures 2 and 3 sketch out possible utility frontiers. Beyond this Ted presents a Private Values benefit-cost test: "A change in the amount of public goods from $y$ to $y'$ passes the private values benefit-cost test if the sum of all consumers' private values for this change exceeds the cost of this change, $C(y') - C(y)$."  Passing this tests indicates potential for private Pareto improvement (sufficient).  Furthermore, Theorem 2 states: "In an economy where Assumptions A.1-A.4 are satisfied and where the initial allocation (x,y) is distributionally efficient: 1. if public good $j$ fails the private values Samuelson test [equation 6, definition 10 in the text], then no increase in the amount of public good $j$ can be potentially Pareto improving. 2. If public good $j$ passes the private values Samuelson test, then no decrease in the amount of public good $j$ can be potentially Pareto improving."

Perhaps the most important insight is how this idea of including only private goods in the cost-benefit analysis essentially is a problem of framing the question: 

* Incorrect: "How much would you be willing to pay to have the larger apartment?"
* Correct: "If the cost of moving to the new apartment is split equally between you, what is the most that you yourself would be willing to pay for the larger apartment?" - or -
* Correct: "How much would you be willing to pay for the benefits that you yourself realize from the larger apartment, ignoring any benefits to the other person?"

Based on this I need to go back to the Ressurreição (2012a, b) papers, which used contingent valuation to calculate how much value is embedded in maintaining biodiversity, and see how they framed their questions.  I was not satisfied with their framing of biodiversity loss in the first place, but potentially the large values they reported may also have been based on the error highlighted in Bergstrom (2006).  Two references in Ted's paper relate to this as well, and I need to follow up with these:

* Coursey, D. L. (1997). Revealed demand for a public good: Evidence from endangered and threatened species, the. NYU Envtl. LJ, 6, 411.
* Loomis, J. B., & White, D. S. (1996). Economic benefits of rare and endangered species: summary and meta-analysis. Ecological Economics, 18(3), 197-206.

Finally, not so much a reflection as a challenge to myself to apply the ideas from this class to earlier courses and topics: Thinking back to the cost-benefit analysis course I took during my Master's program, taught by Gary Libecap - in that course, we used the OECD text on cost benefit analysis: 

* Pearce, D. W., Atkinson, G., & Mourato, S. (2006). Cost-benefit analysis and the environment: recent developments. Paris: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The course was generally oriented around performing cost-benefit analysis by calculating net present values of various proposals, though we spent quite a bit of time as well on the benefits and drawbacks of valuation methods such as contingent valuation and hedonic valuation.  While we didn't cover it in class, I read through the chapter on equity (chapter 15) and found some interesting information about using different weights on costs and benefits to different groups.  While those weights are a normative question, it would be interesting to go back and reread that chapter (as well as a number of others: chapter 12, value of ecosystem services; chapter 16, sustainability; and chapter 19, political economy) with an eye toward the concepts we've learned in this class.
