TO DO:

- consider policies of who bears costs of enforcement
    - voluntary enforcement by community - as programmed?
        - determine present value to TURF
            - this does not include costs to participants?
        - see unitization paper - can I treat it as separate patches with
          separate decisionmakers?
    - social planner (includes costs of enforcement in the DPE)
        - does this make a difference in optimal policy?
