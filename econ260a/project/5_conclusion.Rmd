Here I explored heterogeneity in participation costs that fed back into the population stock, but the conceptual model could be generalized further to affect other aspects of the system: for example, instead of collective enforcement to exclude poachers (to maintain optimal escapement), the collective action could involve habitat restoration (to improve carrying capacity) or culturing larvae (to decrease early life-stage mortality). Multiple collective action opportunities, with different costs of participation, could allow participants to self-sort to minimize costs across the community.  Instead of heterogeneity in participation costs, perhaps the individual patches are heterogeneous in productivity, or the fishers differ in their harvesting costs.  As currently designed, the model is deterministic in all aspects except for participation cost; resilience of the system could be further explored by including stochastic shocks and/or uncertainty in resource productivity.  And certainly the model need not apply only to TURFs, but could easily be generalized to other contexts such as forestry or irrigation rights.  The base model could readily be extended to explore each of these ideas in more depth.

Importantly, the heterogeneity of costs and benefits need not solely reflect financial values.  Studies and models of "critical mass" facilitating collective action [e.g. @heckathorn_1993; @olson_1965; @oliver_1985] allow for heterogeneity in _interest_ in the public good as well as heterogeneity in resources and costs associated with public good provision.  Community members that value an environmental heritage above and beyond the financial rewards for harvest, such as a strong land (or ocean) ethic or deep sense of place, are likely to perceive greater benefits to collective action, and thus be moved toward sustained cooperation.  

This simple model of heterogeneous participation costs shows results that echo expectations and empirical evidence around the success and failure of collective management of renewable natural resources.  Clearly many other factors play into such situations, but understanding this as a potential mechanism can inform the design of institutions to better sustain long-term cooperation in conservation.
