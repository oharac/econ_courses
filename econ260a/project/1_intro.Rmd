Collective action solutions to environmental problems have been shown to be effective in such varied contexts as forestry, water management, and small scale fisheries [@ostrom_1990].  It is well understood through both theoretical literature and empirical evidence that sustained collective action faces challenges due to problems of coordination, disagreement over distributional effects, and temptation to free ride [@olson_1965; @ostrom_1990, and many others].  

Long-term sustainable management of natural resources in a collective action context often takes the form of limitations on resource use, active management of the resource, and/or enforcement of exclusion of outsiders.  Certain characteristics of the resource and resource-using community are understood to have significant impact on the likelihood of success of a collective action effort, e.g. a resource to which access is more easily excluded is easier to maintain through collective action.  Other characteristics include condition of the resource, trust among the user community, experience with organizing within the community, and the strength of dependence upon the resource.  Group size and group heterogeneity are also generally assumed to have a strong influence on the prospects of success for a collective action undertaking [@agrawal_2001; @poteete_2004].  Heterogeneity can impose a positive or a negative influence on establishing and maintaining cooperation depending on the context [@heckathorn_1993]; thus it is critical to specify the type of heterogeneity that is expected to influence collective action [@poteete_2004].

Poteete and Ostrom [-@poteete_2004] describe situations in which locational differences (i.e. proximity to the resource) can impose high costs of participation in activities related to duties and benefits of resource use simply due to the difficulty of access (e.g. walking time).  While locational heterogeneity would be expected to be detrimental to cooperation, institutional rules that account for such heterogeneity can overcome this effect [@varughese_1999a].

While the initial establishment of cooperation seems particularly perilous, even the ongoing cooperation of a previously-cooperating group can be disrupted when the user-resource system is perturbed away from an equilibrium [@huberman_1995].  

To explore the factors that may contribute to the collapse of established cooperation in an environmental context, I will model a multiple agent resource user community with homogeneous ability to extract a renewable natural resource but heterogeneous costs to participate in a collective action to maintain the natural resource.  These participation costs might represent opportunity costs (e.g., participation in the collective action might preclude taking on a lucrative second job) or incurred costs (e.g., cost of personal equipment, materials, or fuel).

In Part 2 I develop a simple model for numerical analysis.  In Part 3 I establish benchmarks based on simulations across a finite time span, including metrics of present value, rate of collapse to open access, and time (periods) to collapse; these are used to develop intuition around comparative statics related to these metrics.  In Part 4 I discuss implications and potential policy options based on intuitions developed from the benchmarks.  I conclude in part 5.
